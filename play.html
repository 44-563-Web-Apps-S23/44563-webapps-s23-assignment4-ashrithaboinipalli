    THE BOOR by Anton Tchekov
</h3>
<h5>LUKA</h5>
<p>[_Entering with glass._]</p> 
<p>You take great liberty, sir.</p>
<h5>SMIRNOV.</h5>
<p>[_Angrily._]</p>
<p>What?</p>
<h5>LUKA.</h5>
<p>I--I--I just----</p>
<h5>SMIRNOV.</h5>
<p>Whom are you talking to? Keep quiet.</p>
<h5>LUKA.</h5>
<p>[_Angrily._]</p>
<p>Nice mess! This fellow won't leave!</p>
<p>[_He goes out._</p>
<h5>SMIRNOV.</h5>
<p>
    Lord, how angry I am! Angry enough to throw mud at the whole
    world! I even feel ill! Servant!
</p>
<p>[MRS. POPOV _comes in with downcast eyes_.</p>
<h5>MRS. POPOV.</h5>
<p>
    Sir, in my solitude I have become unaccustomed to the human
    voice and I cannot stand the sound of loud talking. I beg you, please to
    cease disturbing my rest.
</p>
<h5>SMIRNOV.</h5>
<p>Pay me my money and I'll leave.</p>
<h5>MRS. POPOV.</h5>
<p>
    I told you once, plainly, in your native tongue, that I
    haven't the money at hand; wait until day after to-morrow.
</p>  
<h5>SMIRNOV.</h5>
<p>Then I'll sit here until I get the money.</p>
<p>[_He sits down._]</p>
<p>
    Youwill pay day after to-morrow? Excellent! Here I stay 
    until day after to-morrow.
</p>
<p>[_Jumps up._]</p>
<p>
    I ask you, do I have to pay that interest
    to-morrow or not? Or do you think I'm joking?
