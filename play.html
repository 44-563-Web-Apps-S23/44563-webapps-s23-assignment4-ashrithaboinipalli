    THE BOOR by Anton Tchekov
</h3>
<p>
    LUKA. [_Entering with glass._] You take great liberty, sir.
<br>

SMIRNOV. [_Angrily._] What?
<br>

LUKA. I--I--I just----
<br>
SMIRNOV. Whom are you talking to? Keep quiet.
<br>
LUKA. [_Angrily._] Nice mess! This fellow won't leave! [_He goes out._
<br>
SMIRNOV. Lord, how angry I am! Angry enough to throw mud at the whole
world! I even feel ill! Servant!
<br>
     [MRS. POPOV _comes in with downcast eyes_.
     <br>
MRS. POPOV. Sir, in my solitude I have become unaccustomed to the human
voice and I cannot stand the sound of loud talking. I beg you, please to
cease disturbing my rest.
<br>
SMIRNOV. Pay me my money and I'll leave.
<br>
MRS. POPOV. I told you once, plainly, in your native tongue, that I
haven't the money at hand; wait until day after to-morrow.
<br>
SMIRNOV. And I also had the honor of informing you in your native tongue
that I need the money, not day after to-morrow, but to-day. If you don't
pay me to-day I shall have to hang myself to-morrow.
<br>
MRS. POPOV. But what can I do if I haven't the money?
<br>
SMIRNOV. So you are not going to pay immediately? You're not?
<br>
MRS. POPOV. I cannot.
<br>
SMIRNOV. Then I'll sit here until I get the money. [_He sits down._] You
will pay day after to-morrow? Excellent! Here I stay until day after
to-morrow. [_Jumps up._] I ask you, do I have to pay that interest
to-morrow or not? Or do you think I'm joking?
<br>
MRS. POPOV. Sir, I beg of you, don't scream! This is not a stable.
<br>
SMIRNOV. I'm not talking about stables, I'm asking you whether I have to
pay that interest to-morrow or not?
<br>
MRS. POPOV. You have no idea how to treat a lady.
<br>
SMIRNOV. Oh, yes, I have.
<br>
MRS. POPOV. No, you have not. You are an ill-bred, vulgar person!
Respectable people don't speak so to ladies.
<br>
SMIRNOV. How remarkable! How do you want one to speak to you? In French,
perhaps! Madame, je vous prie! Pardon me for having disturbed you. What
beautiful weather we are having to-day! And how this mourning becomes
you! [_He makes a low bow with mock ceremony._
<br>
MRS. POPOV. Not at all funny! I think it vulgar!
